System Initialization
Step-by-Step Algorithm:
Power on all hardware components (controllers, sensors, actuators).
Load the latest inventory database.
Perform a safety and environment check (ensure no obstacles or malfunctions).
Task Reception
Receive a task from the central management system:
Store an incoming item
Retrieve an existing item
Read the product information (e.g., barcode, size, weight, storage requirements).
Location Planning
For storing: choose the optimal available shelf position based on item type and size.
For retrieving: locate the item's current position.
Plan a collision-free path from the current location to the target location.
Autonomous Navigation
Navigate through the warehouse using onboard sensors (LIDAR, ultrasonic, or IR).
Avoid obstacles dynamically.
Stop or reroute if unexpected obstructions are detected.
Pick or Place Operation
Align the robotic arm with the target item or shelf.
Activate the gripper or suction system to pick or place the item.
Verify success using feedback sensors (e.g., weight sensor or encoder).
Inventory Update
Send real-time updates to the central database, including item location and status.
Log the operation with time, date, and task ID for auditing.
Return to Home Position
Move the robot to a predefined standby location.

Remain idle while awaiting the next command.
